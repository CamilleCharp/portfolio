This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## What is this project

This code is for [My portfolio](https://ccharp.dev).

## What techno and tools did I use

To make my portfolio I use NextJS 13 in order to use SSG easily.
For styling I use Tailwind for prototyping and kept some helpers (Text sizes, colors, ...) and CSS Module (with SCSS) for general styling.
I use EmailJS to send me the contact messages sent through the form.

I plan on using i18n to add French content and possibly Dutch.

## Special thanks

I would like to thank HeroIcons for the multiple Icons used through the site and Unsplash for the projects background image
